An eleven-year old  girl Yangdol and her twin brother Dorjay live in one of the villages of this region. They love their  surroundings—the majestic mountain peaks, and the glaciers, but their favourite is the night sky when the entire sky is lit up with thousands of stars (Fig. 12.1). The weather in Nubra is almost cloudless. With almost no air or light pollution, the night sky is very clearly visible. Night after night, Yangdol and Dorjay observe the stars and experience an immense sense of awe. Fig. 12.1: The beauty of night sky from a very dark  location in Ladakh, India Nubra in Ladakh, India Chapter 12.indd   231 10-07-2024   18:13:26  Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6 232Growing up, Yangdol and Dorjay have been hearing  interesting stories about stars from their elders. They have  heard how some particular stars in the clear skies helped the caravans passing through Nubra in finding direction in the ancient days. They wonder how far away and how big the stars are. They also enjoy trying to find some patterns among the stars that remind them of familiar objects. Have you ever looked at the stars in the night sky and tried to connect them with imaginary lines, just like dots and lines in a drawing? Activity 12.1: Let us draw  \\x8bFig. 12.2 shows bright stars in one part of the night sky. \\x8bLook at it carefully and try to imagine a pattern formed by a group of stars. \\x8bDraw lines to connect the stars and make the pattern. \\x8bThink of an animal or an object that is similar to the pattern drawn by you. Write its name near your pattern.12.1 Stars and Constellations At night, when we look up at the sky, we see many stars. Some stars are bright and others  are dim. Stars shine with their own light. Some groups of stars appear to form  patterns which are like shapes of familiar things. Long ago, when watching stars in the night sky was a favourite pastime of our ancestors, they identified these star patterns with animals, things or characters in stories. Many cultures had names for patterns based on their own stories. These imaginary shapes helped them in recognising stars in the sky. Recognising stars and their patterns was a useful skill  for navigation in the olden times. Before the arrival of modern technology or even before the invention of the magnetic compass, it helped people, particularly sailors and travellers, in finding directions at sea or on land. It is still used in emergencies as a backup method. In earlier times, groups of stars forming patterns were  called constellations. Currently, the regions of sky, which include these groups of stars, are defined as constellations. However , since in constellations, the patterns of stars are often the most prominent, the term constellation is still  commonly used for these groups of stars. Fig. 12.2: A part of the night sky  \\x8bRepeat the above steps and make some more patterns. \\x8bNow think of an interesting story about your patterns. Compare your  patterns with the patterns drawn by your friends. Are the patterns same or different? Narrate your story to others and listen to their stories. Do you notice that everyone’s patterns, names and stories are different? Is it not fun?

      "\n",
      "### Key Features of the Solar System Representation:\n",
      "1. **Objects Shown**:\n",
      "   - The **Sun** (central star).\n",
      "   - The **eight planets** in order from the Sun:  \n",
      "     - Mercury  \n",
      "     - Venus  \n",
      "     - Earth  \n",
      "     - Mars  \n",
      "     - Jupiter  \n",
      "     - Saturn  \n",
      "     - Uranus  \n",
      "     - Neptune  \n",
      "   - The **Asteroid Belt** (between Mars and Jupiter).  \n",
      "   - Pluto is mentioned but labeled as a *dwarf planet* (not part of the eight planets).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Artistic Notes**:\n",
      "   - The figure is **not to scale** (sizes and distances are distorted to fit the page).  \n",
      "   - Planets are depicted with simplified features (e.g., rings around gas giants like Saturn).  \n",
      "   - The Earth is highlighted as the \"Blue Planet\" due to its water-covered surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Additional Context**:\n",
      "   - The text clarifies that Venus is often called the \"Morning Star\" or \"Evening Star\" (though it’s not a star).  \n",
      "   - Mars is labeled the \"Red Planet\" because of its reddish soil.  \n",
      "   - The four outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune) are described as gas giants with ring systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Purpose:\n",
      "The image helps visualize the layout of the Solar System, though it emphasizes that **actual distances and sizes are vastly different** (e.g., the Sun is 100 times larger than Earth in diameter but appears small due to distance).\n",
      "\n",
