However , there are a few comets that escape and move out of the Solar System. Few other comets get broken up, or fall into the Sun or other planets when they approach them.12.4 The Milky Way Galaxy
In the moonless night sky, viewed from dark locations away from city lights, one can see an extended faint band of light from near north to south across the sky (Fig. 12.11). This is our home galaxy called the Milky Way Galaxy or Ākāśha Gangā. A galaxy has millions to billions of stars. Our Solar System is part of the Milky Way Galaxy. Fig. 12.10: A Comet
We have learnt about the 
objects which form the Solar System. Which are these objects? The Sun, eight planets, their moons, and many smaller objects including asteroids, and comets, together form the Solar System. The Sun—our star—is the 
largest and the heaviest object in the Solar System. The Sun produces almost all the energy in the Solar System. All other objects in our Solar System shine due to the sunlight that they reflect from their surfaces. 12.5 The Universe
There are many galaxies in the outer space beyond the Milky Way Galaxy. Scientists study them to understand the stars, galaxies and the universe. In Sanskrit and a 
few other Indian languages, a comet is called Dhūmaketu. Various tribes in India also call it Pucchya- Taro  
(star with a tail) or Zendya-Taro  (star like a flag). In many cultures, comets have been feared and it was earlier believed that comets bring bad luck. However , thanks to scientists, we now know that these are just icy-rocky visitors making a trip close to the Sun! One famous comet is the 
Halley’s Comet which appears every 76 years. Its last appearance was in 1986. More to 
know! What is

12.5 The Universe
There are many galaxies in the outer space beyond the Milky Way Galaxy. Scientists study them to understand the stars, galaxies and the universe.What is 
beyond the 
Milky Way 
Galaxy? Is there life 
anywhere 
else in the 
Universe? We do not know yet if life exists 
elsewhere in the Universe. The search for life has been directed mostly towards exoplanets—the planets discovered revolving around other stars in our galaxy. Till now, scientists have not found any evidence of life but this search is on and continuing. Chapter 12.indd   247 10-07-2024   18:19:42

Summary
 The sky is divided into regions called constellations, which 
include groups of stars that appear to form patterns. The Pole Star appears stationary in the North direction, which helps in locating the North direction in the Northern hemisphere. The Sun is a star which produces heat and light. A planet is a large, nearly spherical object that revolves around the Sun.

Beyond Earth249 The eight planets, in order of their increasing distance 
from the Sun, are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter , Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. The Earth revolves around the Sun in nearly one year . Objects that move around planets are commonly called satellites. The Moon is Earth’s natural satellite. The Moon revolves around the Earth in nearly 27 days. The Sun, eight planets, their moons, and many smaller objects including asteroids and comets, together form the Solar System. Our Solar System is part of the Milk
