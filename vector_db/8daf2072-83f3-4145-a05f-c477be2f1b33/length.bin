Many Higher Education  Institutions conduct night sky watching activities for school students. There are many Amateur Astronomy  Clubs all over the  country which  organise sky watching events periodically. Museums and Planetariums also organise similar events. Do you  know?How can we  see the planets  which are not  visible to the  naked eye? We know that  planets move  around the Sun. Are there any  objects that move  around planets?

They are smaller in size than planets. Moons are natural satellites of planets. The Earth has one Moon, while Mars has two moons. Jupiter , Saturn, Uranus and Neptune have a large number of moons.

It is our nearest neighbour in the space. Unlike on the Earth, there is hardly any atmosphere on the Moon. How big is the Moon as compared to the Earth? The Moon is about a quarter the size of the Earth in diameter . The Moon’s surface shows circular bowl-like structures called craters (Fig. 12.9). Most of these craters have been formed due to the impact of asteroids or rocks from the space hitting the Moon’s surface. Since there is no atmosphere, water or  In general, any object  that moves around a much larger object can also be called a satellite. For example, Earth can be considered a satellite of the Sun. The Moon is about 3,84,000 km away from the Earth.More to  know!

The third mission, Chandrayaan-3, was launched in July 2023 and its Vikram lander carrying the Pragyan rover successfully soft-landed on the Moon on August 23, 2023. With  this mission, India became the first country in the world to  achieve a landing near the little explored Moon’s south pole. To mark this success, the Government of India declared August 23 to be celebrated as ‘National Space Day’ in India. A fourth mission, Chandrayaan-4, is being planned which aims to bring back soil and rock samples from the Moon. Do you  know? Asteroids The Sun and the planets are nearly spherical in shape. There  are many small objects in the Solar System which are rocky and irregular in shape. These are called asteroids. Many of these asteroids revolve around the Sun in paths that lie between those of Mars and Jupiter . This region is called the asteroid belt (Fig. 12.7). Occasionally, asteroids pass very close to the Earth. Comets Sometimes we have visitors from the outer regions of the Solar System! These objects with long tails are called comets (Fig. 12.10). They are made up of dust, gases, rocks and ice. As a comet approaches close to the Sun, the frozen material in it starts evaporating. This evaporating  The sizes of  asteroids are from 10 m to about 500 km.More to  know!life on the Moon, these features stay on the Moon’s surface  for a very long time. Although the Moon is very far , humans have sent  spacecrafts to explore and understand more about the Moon. India has also launched three Chandrayaan missions to study the Moon, and a further mission is being planned.

Comets appear dim as  they move away from the Sun and then, it is not possible to see them with the naked eye. Many comets have been  found that revolve around the Sun. These comets approach close to the Sun periodically. However , there are a few comets that escape and move out of the Solar
