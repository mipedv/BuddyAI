+¾{chroma:documentSome groups of stars appear to form  patterns which are like shapes of familiar things. Long ago, when watching stars in the night sky was a favourite pastime of our ancestors, they identified these star patterns with animals, things or characters in stories. Many cultures had names for patterns based on their own stories. These imaginary shapes helped them in recognising stars in the sky. Recognising stars and their patterns was a useful skill  for navigation in the olden times. Before the arrival of modern technology or even before the invention of the magnetic compass, it helped people, particularly sailors and travellers, in finding directions at sea or on land. It is still used in emergencies as a backup method. In earlier times, groups of stars forming patterns were  called constellations. Currently, the regions of sky, which include these groups of stars, are defined as constellations. However , since in constellations, the patterns of stars are often the most prominent, the term constellation is still  commonly used for these groups of stars. Do we find patterns  among the stars just  for fun or is there  some use of these  patterns? Since different cultures denoted the constellation  boundaries in different ways, an internationally agreed set of constellation boundaries were defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in the early 20th century. 88 constellations were officially listed, thus, dividing the entire sky into 88 regions. These regions of sky are now defined as constellations. More to  know! Some constellations are shown in Fig. 12.3. The stars  are joined by imaginary lines, drawn for easy identification. The constellation Orion is often represented as a hunter . There are three stars in the middle, which represent the belt of the hunter . Some people imagine that the hunter Orion, followed by his dog (constellation Canis Major), is battling a bull (constellation Taurus). Canis Major contains a star  Chapter 12.indd   233 10-07-2024   18:13:46  Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6 234Fig. 12.3: Some constellations and stars (The red lines indicate the patterns of stars while the green lines indicate the  regions of the sky.

The Pole Star or Polaris,  which is part of the Little Dipper is also shown (Fig. 12.4). The Pole Star appears stationary in the North direction,  which helps to locate the North direction in the Northern hemisphere. The Big Dipper lies in the  constellation Ursa Major while the Little Dipper lies in the constellation Ursa Minor . In India, the Big Dipper is known as Saptaá¹›iá¹£hi, and the  Pole Star is known as   Dhruva  tÄrÄ. More to  know! Apart from common regional stories associated with stars in the constellations, many forest dwelling communities or tribes of India also have their own stories about them. For example, the four stars in the Big Dipper that approximately form a rectangle, are viewed by tribes in Central India as the â€œgrandmotherâ€™s cotâ€ with the three thieves (other three stars) stealing it. Fishermen along the Konkan coast imagine the four stars as a boat, with the last three stars as the neck of the boat. Do you  know? How can  we identify  some of t
